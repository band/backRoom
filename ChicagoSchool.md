Neoliberal economics championed by Morton Friedman and distributed with devastating consequences in South America.
A perfect free market: no regulations, no taxes, no public goods. Then we add in humans and get them to believe that their only task is to care for themselves, in an "every person is on their own" social scheme. That sounds great, no?
Naomi Klein's 2007 book [The Shock Doctrine](shockDoctrine.md) details just how in-humane such economic prescriptions can be. And also how the abstraction of economic principles and policies from actual lived experiences of the people living in that society is an example of [evasive thinking](evasiveThinking.md) .
