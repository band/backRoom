Social defenses; resistance to change; neuroscience explanations.

Does modeling behavior in terms of neuroscience, neurochemistry, etc., promote an attitude of reliquishing personal responsibility for one's behaviors?  

(Damnit. I hate learning all these new editors. Now this is being promoted for writing an idea creation, but it you do not give the document a name that ends in ".md" there is not line wrapping. Gah! Well, at least it wraps once it is named. But still.)
(OK. Looking in settings I found the switch to turn word-wrap on. Might have been smart to look there first. Using a programming language editor as an editor of choice for "idea" creation, collection, and linking, bumps into conflicting work practices. Yes?)
